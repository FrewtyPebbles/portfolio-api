		The Purpose Of Neat Notation
	</h2>
	<p>
			The purpose of neat notation
		is to be a scaleable and readable 
		notation for writing config files for
		the python programming language.
	</p>

		How It Works
	</h2>
	<h3 class="title sub-title">
		1. The Tokenizer
	</h3>
	<p>
			The tokenizer itterates through 
		the input file/string and simplifies the 
		input file into a list of tokens to 
		make the next steps in parsing easier.
		The tokens are generated with a stack
		based on delimeters.  Tokens are mostly
		enumerators that encapsulate a value that
		is used in the next step of the process.

		2. Building the Node Tree
	</h3>
	<p>
			The list of tokens is then itterated
		through and each token is handled in a 
		match statement.  When a start of scope
		token is matched, an empty node object is
		added to a stack. single elements are then
		added to the top item in the stack's children
		until the end of that scope is reached.
		When the end of that scope is reached,
		the top of the stack is appended to node
		below it's children and popped from the
		stack. At the end of this step, a node
		tree is created and sent to the next
		step in the process.
	</p>

		2. Serializing the Node Tree Into Json
	</h3>
	<p>
			Neat is serialized into Json as an
		intermediary notation because I felt that 
		Json was the most universally compatible 
		object notation with most languages.  In 
		doing this, if I decide to add support for 
		neat notation in other languages, it will 
		be much easier to implement.
